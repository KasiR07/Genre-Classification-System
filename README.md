# Abstract
The traditional classification of music that brings together songs with a similar style is known as a genre.  Making the selection of songs easier and quicker is the goal of automating the music classification. In this study, a deep learning method for categorising music genres is integrated with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).This approach will be very useful while applying it into music recommendation systems, music streaming services, and music analysis tools. Overall, the proposed system represents an exciting and promising approach to music genre classification, and has the potential to revolutionize the way we analyze and enjoy music.

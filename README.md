# Genre-Classification-System
The project aims to develop a Genre identification system that can accurately determine the genre of a song by analyzing its waveforms. By leveraging Machine learning techniques and audio signal processing, we will extract relevant features from the waveforms and train a classification model to recognize various music genres.

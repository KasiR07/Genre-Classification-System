# Abstract
The traditional classification of music that brings together songs with a similar style is known as a genre.  Making the selection of songs easier and quicker is the goal of automating the music classification. In this study, a deep learning method for categorising music genres is integrated with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).This approach will be very useful while applying it into music recommendation systems, music streaming services, and music analysis tools. Overall, the proposed system represents an exciting and promising approach to music genre classification, and has the potential to revolutionize the way we analyze and enjoy music.

# Introduction
Our project aims to develop a Genre identification system that can accurately determine the genre of a song by analyzing its waveforms. By leveraging Machine learning techniques and audio signal processing, we will extract relevant features from the waveforms and train a classification model to recognize various music genres. This system will enable users to upload songs or provide links to songs, and it will provide them with real-time feedback on the genre they are listening to.

# Concepts Used
The concept used in this project revolves around the analysis of audio waveforms to identify the genre of a song. Waveform analysis involves studying the patterns and characteristics of the audio signal over time. Machine learning algorithms are then employed to train a classification model that can recognize different music genres based on these extracted features. This concept combines audio signal processing techniques, feature extraction, and machine learning to create a robust and accurate genre identification system.

# Business Use Case
The genre identification system developed in this project presents a valuable business use case for music platforms. Music platforms can leverage this technology to provide personalized recommendations, curated playlists, and tailored user experiences based on individual genre preferences. Ultimately, the genre identification system enhances the competitive edge of music platforms.

#Important Use Case
The genre identification system developed in this project serves as an important tool for music education. It allows students and educators to analyze and understand different music genres by analyzing their waveforms. Students can explore various genres, learn about their distinguishing features, and develop a deeper appreciation for different musical styles. This use case promotes music literacy, broadens students' musical horizons, and nurtures a well-rounded music education.
